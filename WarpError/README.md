# WarpError

## 1 Pre-requisite

Note that this warp error is implemented using Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.0

Please build an appropriate environment for the PWC-Net to compute optical flow

## 2 Download pre-trained model

Please download at this [link]()

Then put this model under the current path

## 3 Use the code

Change the `base_path`
